Matlab - exercises and projects

The laboratory exercises were meant for the "System Identification" discipline

ðŸ’»Project 1 --> Linear Regression

Given an unkown function we develop a Polynomial Approximator getting a function as close as possible to the unkown one.
Tuning the 'mean square error' for the best fit possible.


ðŸ’» Project 2 --> Nonlinear ARX identification

A dataset is given, measured on an unknown dynamic system with one input and one output.
I developed a black-box model for this system, using a polynomial, nonlinear ARX model.
